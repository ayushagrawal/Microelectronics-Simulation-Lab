MATLAB Code Files implement the following:

Setup and solve Poisson equation for a PN junction at equilibrium. Use (a) abrupt and (b) linear graded junctions.
Determine the energy band diagram and electron and hole densities as a function of position (x), from the bulk of P region, via the depletion region to bulk of N region. 
Use Boltzmann distributed electron and hole density (do not make the textbook depletion approximation).
Compare the results obtained so far with those obtained by empirical formulation (textbook approach, depletion approximation).
Choose suitable doping for P/N and P+/N junctions.
